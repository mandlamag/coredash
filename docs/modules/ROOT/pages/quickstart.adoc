There are three easy ways to run NeoDash and start dashboarding your Neo4j data:

. The latest version is always available online:
https://neodash.graphapp.io.
. Neo4j Desktop: Install it from the https://install.graphapp.io[Graph
App Gallery].
. Using Docker:
```
docker pull neo4jlabs/neodash:latest
docker run -it --rm -p 5005:5005 neo4jlabs/neodash
```

Or, build it yourself:
```
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neodash     
yarn install      
yarn run dev
```

NeoDash connects to any GraphQL API endpoint that supports the Neo4j-compatible GraphQL schema. 
The application also supports a "Skip Login" feature that allows you to run queries without authentication, 
which is particularly useful for development and testing scenarios.

Previously, NeoDash required a direct Neo4j database connection (Neo4j 4.0 or later), but the application 
now uses a GraphQL API client layer for all database interactions.

To get started with building your own dashboard, see the Dashboards
page.
